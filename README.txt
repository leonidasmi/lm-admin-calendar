Calendar/Journal for the WordPress users of a site

== Description ==

**LM Admin Calendar** enables the users of a website to organize their upcoming events in a calendar. This plugin is light and coded with best practice.

The user's events are saved as Custom Post Types and a custom dashboard widget displays them in a calendar.

The plugin uses [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) for the data structure, [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) for enforcing coding conventions and [Full Callendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) for the event calendar.

How to use: 

* Go to Events -> Add New Event
* Create a new Event along with its categories and date
* After the Event creation, a event in the Calendar Dashboard Widget will be added
* Click the Event on the calendar to see its details (Date, Categories)
